# Portfolio

## Description

This Portfolio project was done to create my first portfolio as a developer. I wanted to do this to not only practice what I've been learning but also to implement it and use it to build a base Portfolio. This will serve as a rough draft that I will build on until satisfied with a final version that I will share with future prospective employers and/or piers.
